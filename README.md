## 🚀 Motivation

I’m a **final-year engineering student** aiming to become a **skilled full stack developer**. Until now, I’ve built some projects using JavaScript, React, and Node.js, but most of it was through trial-and-error and vibe coding. I wanted a structured path to truly understand **how things work end-to-end**.
